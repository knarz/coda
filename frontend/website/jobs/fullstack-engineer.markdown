Help us build accessible, usable, delightful products on top of the Coda Protocol!

We’re seeking a full-stack product engineer who is also excited about building productivity tools for developers. While it's hard to say exactly what we'll work on given that we are such an early-stage startup, we expect projects to include:

- Developer tools and SDKs to build applications on top of Coda
- The command-line interface (CLI) to interact with the Coda client and daemon
- Automated services and bots that allows users to engage with the Coda network

## Requirements

- 2+ years engineering experience
    - Bonus: Experience building developer-facing APIs and libraries
- Willingness to work on-site in a San Francisco based office
- Knowledge and passion for React internals
    - Bonus: Experience with React Hooks or GraphQL
- Experience with AWS or other public cloud providers
- Familiarity with functional programming, know your way around map and reduce.

## Nice to have (at least one of the following)

- Experience working on collaborative projects with a product team (or larger team-based projects at a university/bootcamp)
- Exposure to working with cryptocurrencies
- Experience with ReasonML, OCaml, Haskell, or Rust
- Early stage startup experience
- Experience with contributing to Open Source

## About us

O(1) Labs is aiming to develop the first cryptocurrency protocol that can deliver on the promise of supporting real-world applications and widespread use. Our team is based in San Francisco, and we are funded by top investors (including Polychain, Metastable, Max Levchin, and Naval Ravikant).

We’re bringing Coda Protocol to market, a cryptocurrency that compresses the blockchain from hundreds of gigabytes down to the size of a few tweets. It can scale to thousands of transactions per second and millions of users while remaining decentralized enough for cellphones to be fully verifying nodes.

We’re working on technologies with the potential to reimagine social structures. We believe it’s important to incorporate diverse perspectives from conception through realization.

This is a chance to join a small, collaborative team and have a ton of independence while working on fascinating cross-disciplinary problems that span cryptography, engineering, product design, economics, and sociology. We also offer competitive compensation both in salary and equity as well as top-of-the-market benefits.

If you'd be interested in talking further, please get in touch by sending an email with your resume and the subject "Full-stack Product Engineer Applicant" to [jobs@o1labs.org](mailto:jobs@o1labs.org?subject="Full-stack Product Engineer").

We are committed to building a diverse, inclusive company. People of color, LGBTQ individuals, women, and people with disabilities are strongly encouraged to apply.
